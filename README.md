## Hey! You've Made To My Github :smile: 


### I'm Ifeoluwa
I can proudly say I began my love for coding at Flatiron School! I am obsessed with finding solutions, and different types of solutions. Just ask my husband - I'm addicted to "fixing" things!
- ðŸ¤¯ Iâ€™m most likely learning another language/framework as you're reading this.
- :musical_keyboard: Ask me about how listening to [Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfPxlb8-ZQ0&list=PLthkYcpMPSRxRZsVQuWtEb2hsEPZIi9fl&ab_channel=Musictag) improves coding!
